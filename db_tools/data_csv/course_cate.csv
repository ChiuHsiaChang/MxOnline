For millennia, the people of Britain had been using bronze to make tools and jewelry, and as a currency for trade. But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing social upheaval and an economic crisis‚Äî what we would call a recession today. So what causes recessions? Richard Coffin digs into the economic fluctuations that affect our modern markets.

Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world; in the United States, close to ten percent of adults struggle with the disease. But because it‚Äôs a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand than, say, high cholesterol. Helen M. Farrell examines the symptoms and treatments of depression, and gives some tips for how you might help a friend who is suffering.

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.

People have always wanted to know what the future holds for them. It's what makes us humans and also the reason why fortune tellers have always been so popular. And some still are‚Ä¶ 
Take Nostradamus for example: he is a semi-mythical personality, in addition, there's no proof the prophecies actually belong to him. Besides, Nostradamus was an alchemist, which is not very scientific, especially for 21st century people. 
However, today we have our own prophets, which are much more trustworthy. One of them was Stephen Hawking. This English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, writer and recognized genius made several important predictions about the future of humankind and our planet. And they are really scary. Why?

Hi I am Ann Reardon, How to Cook That is my youtube channel.  Is there plastic in rice? Is there meat glue in steak?  Is my meat glued together?  What does meat glue look like?  Do impure spices burn? How to tell if vitamins are synthetic? Why do cheese singles burn?  Why does processed cheese burn with a flame?  Does salt contain chalk?  Is my food fake?

But it seems like since then things have just taken a COMPLETE left turn and the integrity of the Men's Health video team in terms of providing quality content has just dissipated.  Is this hate or is this bringing attention to the widespread of misinformation and utter GAHHHBAGE that has become YouTube Fitness?

I know what I'm doing in the gym, so stuff like this doesn't impact my workout.  But if you're a fan of Tom Ellis, who is an AMAZING actor, you're more than likely going to trust the advice given in this video because MEN'S HEALTH puts their seal of approval on it and that is just WRONG!

Important note: Beginner modification is only for Beginner who just started exercising. If you are not, you should be doing my version and try to keep up with my pace... You will feel the burn! :)

Warming up your body before going all-out is crucial. 

I would recommend everyone to spend at least 5-10 minutes doing some dynamic warm up on light to moderate intensity. I would personally go through 1 round of this exercise routine with moderate effort before I start pushing myself hard. Doing the beginner modification routine for 1 round before your actual working set can be a good way to get ready too.

After each round. Pause the video take 2 minutes rest. It's gonna be hard, I know... but hey, this is what melt away the fat like crazy and a build a fitter stronger you!

Al the best! ;)

Important note: Unfortunately, there is no Beginner modification in this workout. This routine are made for Intermediate-Advanced, or anyone who likes to undergo something a little more challenging from my workouts. 

However, if you are a fresh Beginner but you really, really want to do this workout. Then, I would recommend you to stick to the Round 1 format, if you felt OK... You might be able to do the Round 2-3 version, who knows? ;)

This easy beginner yoga class is a wonderful way to start or end your day. A gentle yoga flow that is great for beginners or anyone that wants a more easy and relaxing practice. An all levels yoga class done on the beautiful beach right outside of Tampa Bay at Fort De Soto Beach will allow you to connect with your breath, let go of any tension in your body, and truly calm the mind. It is neither solely a sunset yoga flow or sunset yoga class because it is truly both... a yoga class for resetting and realignment at either the beginning or end of your day. 

Find a quiet space, light some candles, turn off all distractions, and gift yourself this 15 min yoga class to let go of all that no longer serves you. 

Love & Light,

Juliana and Mark

But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.
Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.
But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.
Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.

The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. The Library quickly acquired a large number of papyrus scrolls, due largely to the Greek Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.

The 1930s was a highpoint for ocean-going liners. Crossing the Atlantic by boat was the only way to reach the US, and competition between the French and British shipyards was never less than fierce, a focus for patriotic pride. The British Queen Mary and French Normandie epitomised the golden age of the ocean liners. They were among the floating Art Deco palaces that competed intensely to win the Blue Riband - a prize for the fastest Atlantic crossing. A Holy Grail for the two countries, this prize was also a great bit of marketing.

While there's something to be said for separating the art from the artist, I think there's a lot of merit in CONTEXTUALIZING the art WITH the artist. Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head. So before you yell at me for Not Separating The Artist From The Art, know that it was completely intentional and I'm not sorry.

As you may have noticed, we like to blow stuff up on this channel. So when the International Red Cross approached us to collaborate on a video about nuclear weapons, we were more than excited.
Until we did the research. It turned out we were a bit oblivious off the real impact of nuclear weapons in the real world, on a real city. And especially, how helpless even the most developed nations on earth would be if an attack occurred today.
So hopefully this video demonstrates how extremely non fun a real world nuclear attack would be, without being too gruesome. This collaboration was a blast (no pun intended) and we want to say a huge thank you to the International Red Cross!

There are many companies working on this type of technology at the moment.  We made ours in 2018, and Chad visited my house in January 2019 to film most of this.  We didn't post it for various reasons, but decided now might be a good time.  The fidelity of the inference is a function of how you train it.... so obviously the more data points you provide, the better it will perform.  This particular type of machine learning is known as object detection, with the computation being performed by a deep neural network ""on the edge"".  The video stream is processed locally and no internet is needed to find the object in real time. If you're working on something similar or could use this technology in your systems and would like to collaborate.... (or would simply like to support what we're doing) please reach out by using this link: https://www.lantern.systems/gun-detector

This video explains Shor‚Äôs Algorithm, a way to efficiently factor large pseudoprime integers into their prime factors using a quantum computer. The quantum computation relies on the number-theoretic analysis of the factoring problem via modular arithmetic mod N (where N is the number to be factored), and finding the order or period of a random coprime number mod N. The exponential speedup comes in part from the use of the quantum fast fourier transform which achieves interference among frequencies that are not related to the period (period-finding is the goal of the QFT FFT).

This video is about how Russian physicist Aleksandr Fridman corrected Albert Einstein about the expansion of the universe. Einstein thought that general relativity implied that space had to be static and unchanging, but he had made a technical error regarding the differentiation of the metric (in particular, I believe he mistook the determinant of the metric for a scalar rather than a tensor density of weight 2). Friedmann didn't make this differential geometric mistake, and the cosmologies he found from the Einstein Equations were more varied in their properties - they could be expanding, or contracting, or (with the cosmological constant), static.

If you have never heard of it -Thermite is a mixture of Iron Oxide (rust) and Aluminum powder. When you ignite it a vigorous chemical reaction takes place which results in liquid iron. Its used industrially for welding metal, the military uses it to destroy enemy equipment, teachers use it for science demonstrations, and youtubers just melt stuff with it.

I made a mold out of insulating firebricks, and set off the thermite over it to fill it with molten steel!

I found very popular youtube channel called Beyond Science (produced by Mike Chen of Strictly Dumpling, Mikey Chen, Eat with Mikey, among others) recently, and it's...not great. It pushes pseudoscience like alien encounters, secret space programs, government conspiracies, ancient aliens, alternate history,  and much more. I'm pleasantly surprised that I didn't come across any multi-level marketing, essential oil, or alternative medicine quackery. Approach this channel with major skepticism.

I can't wait to hear all the stories about astral projection and remote viewing, inside our outside the CIA. Those are never incredibly cringe worthy!

This video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*

Warning: Choking Hazard Small Part. Not for children under 3 years of age. Harmful And Dangerous If Swallowed! Keep Away From Children! 
Get this Water Balz experiment and many others at http://www.incrediblescience.com Have a ball with this fun polymer science experiment! Watch in amazement as your polymer balls which starts out smaller than a small marble grows to the size of a racquetball when placed in water-all in less than a day! Comes in an array of vibrant colors that hold true, even when hydrated. They roll, and even though they do not bounce, they will explode when thrown or dropped! Drop the balls in water and imagine the endless possibilities as they grow before your eyes!
1) Learn about the incredible properties of polymers as you grow the ""balls"".
2)Discuss hydrophilic properties and superabsorbent polymers.
3)Determine how fast evaporation will take place and then start the process again. 4)Hypothesize what will happen once the water evaporates from them.
5)Discuss color, light and classification and how these water absorbers can play a huge part in our environment.
6)Experiment with milk, vegetable oil, or salt water. and more...",https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPK2m0qRZx4,Science

With this amazing kit, you'll mix up your own batch of gravity-defying goo that flows uphill as it ""self-siphons"" from one cup to another! Use the fizzing color tablets to make the ""goo"" in all kinds of colors, grow the spheres, even make them disappear!

Also included are the amazing ""Clear Spheres"" and colorful ""Garbled Marbles"" that absorb up to 300 times their weight in water to become slimy jelly balls that bounce. You'll learn to connect these spherical wonders to your Gravity Goo so that it takes them along for the ride as it sneaks uphill.

Some of the fun activities you will do with this kit are: Self-Siphoning Goo - Colorful Gravity Goo - Growing Spheres - Garbled Goo - Color Spheres - Disappearing Spheres and more! 


    Gravity Goo is an incredible polymer that acts in a very unusual and fun way.
    Gravity Goo combines the sponge-like properties of polyacrylamide polymers and the molecular linking properties of acrylic co-polymers. Those are basically big words that mean that your Gravity Goo is going to soak up lots of water and you'll find that it likes to stick together.

Once they find a secluded spot on your skin, they use two hook-like structures to tear into your flesh. Then they insert a barbed straw and get to work. If that‚Äôs not bad enough, ticks also transmit at least 16 different diseases to humans, such as Lyme. And research suggests that several species of ticks ‚Äî and the diseases they carry ‚Äî are now spreading in the US.
